# AR Octopus / HelloVuforia

This is the final part of a University assignment for the augmented reality (AR) course I took.
The purpose of the project was to familiarise ourselves with 3D scanning, animating, the Unity game engine, and Vuforia.

It was a wonderful project to do, and we enjoyed every single part of the process.

Made with happiness caused by accute octo-plushie cuteness by us, [Ermina Trontzou](https://github.com/ErminaTrontzou/) and [Maciej Ratkiewicz](https://github.com/MaciejRtk95/).

## What it is, how to use it

It's an AR application/game for your Android phone.
The apk is [included in the repository](https://github.com/Erek-Razou/AR-Octopus/raw/main/mobile.apk).

To be usable, you need the [image target](https://github.com/Erek-Razou/AR-Octopus/blob/main/Assets/Editor/Vuforia/ImageTargetTextures/HelloVuforia/il_794xN.2769609519_cvra.png) to be present in the real world.
You need to either print it or just have it displayed on a screen layed flat anywhere you like.

Upon the application detecting the image, you'll see our little octopus swimming in his tank.
You can tap on him to "spook" him and make him swim away to a random place in the tank.

This is something that we didn't know we needed in our lives, but we're surely glad we made it.
Oh, how cute is this little octopus and his danty little swimming legs...
Yes, why not watch him swim until the phone's battery runs out?


## Our process

Our process can be found in detail (and in Greek, but **with pictures**) [in our assignment paper](https://github.com/Erek-Razou/AR-Octopus/blob/main/assignment-paper.pdf).
But, in short:
- We took 358 photos of our plushie. Some upright, some upside down, in a funky setup that made sure the plushie held the same pose between the two takes.
- We used [Metashape from Agisoft](https://www.agisoft.com) to create a 3D model of the plushie.
- We then used [Blender](https://www.blender.org) to add bones to our boneless octopus and animate it.
- Finally, we used [Unity](https://unity.com/) with [Vuforia](https://developer.vuforia.com/library/getting-started/vuforia-engine-package-unity) to make our octopus come to life.


## Thank you

We want to thank Μάρκος Κωνσταντάκης for challenging us to explore with this fun assignment.
We also want to thank the creators of all the powerful tools we used and [NeoT1](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/room-aquarium-now-animated-3d2177c3e90a4379b3484d811c013284) for the aquarium model that made for a wonderful home for our octopus.
